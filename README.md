## Projects created for Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree
### 0. Exploring Weather Trends
This project is made using SQL and Excel. I analyzed local and global temperature data. The goal was to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global and local temperature trends.

### 1. TMDB Movies Analysis
The goal of the project was to analyze data and to find out what successful movies have in common.

### 2. Analyze A/B Testing
For this project, I was working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. My goal was to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

### 3. Data Wrangling
Using Python and its libraries, I gathered data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assessed its quality and tidiness, then cleaned it. 

### 4. Data Visualization
This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In the first part, I used Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, I produced a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that I discovered in selected dataset
