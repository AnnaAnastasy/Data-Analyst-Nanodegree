# Communicate Data Findings
This project in the last part of the "Data Analyst Nanodegree" by Udacity. In this Project, I wrangled and thoroughly analysed a dataset of the bike company BayWheels. The two main goals of this project were:

1. Perform Exploratory Data Visualisation
2. Perform Explanatory Data Visualisation

## Summary of Findings

BayWheels has 2 types of users: subscribers and usual customers. Almost 70% of users of the bike sharing system are subscribers.

I analysed data since January 2019 and it was interesting to see how popularity of BayWheels spiked in January and February 2020 compared to previous year. It looks like they had great potential for this year but due to the global COVID-19 pandemy they had almost 60% fall in March and it fell down even more in April (twice less bike rides compared to March). 

Another interesting observation is that duration of trips has a long-tailed distribution. 99,5 % of trips are made in 2 hours or less and 90% are done in 20 minutes or less. But it differs depending on user type and day of week. 

The average duration of using the bike system is shorter for subscribers than for customers. For the members it's around 10 minutes, while for usual customers - 15. I also noticed that customers use Bay Wheels' bikes on weekends more often then members but they are less active during rush hour (right before and after work). I believe that it depend on how people use the app. Subscribers use it on regular basis for shorter trips to get to / from work, while customers can have different preferences.

On weekends the average trip for all users takes from 12-15 minutes (for early mornings) up to 20 minutes (around 2 pm). And during weekdays it takes from 10 to 14 minutes depending on time of the day.
